<p>This tool runs a SWMM inp file using a SWMM executable.</p>

<p>Optionally provide a SWMM GeoPackage (GPKG) input file to generate the inp first, then run SWMM.</p>

<p>Provide the path to <code>runswmm.exe</code>, or leave it blank if the executable is in a standard path like <code>C:\Program Files\EPA SWMM 5.2.2</code>. Typically the default path search should be enough. If multiple SWMM installations are present the latest version is picked by default.</p>

<p>If report/output files are not specified, they are written next to the inp file with <code>.rpt</code> and <code>.out</code> extensions.</p>

<p>After the run completes, the report is scanned and up to 10 lines containing
<code>ERROR</code> or <code>WARNING</code> are printed in the QGIS log. If more exist the log is truncated.</p>
